# CS480-PlantPredictTraits
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting plant traits using a combination of deep learning and regression models. The project leverages the pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer model to extract features from plant images and combines these features with ancillary environmental data. Separate CatBoost regression models are then trained to predict six specific plant traits. This approach demonstrates the potential of integrating advanced deep learning models with robust regression techniques for accurate ecological predictions.

To run the notebook, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- scikit-learn
- CatBoost
- tqdm
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)
